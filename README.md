# Basic Hacking and Security
I have been the admin of [Fandom's Official CE Wiki](https://cheat-engine-restored.fandom.com/wiki/Cheat_Engine_Wiki) since May 2020. From then till September 2021, I wrote tutorials; coded video game mods/hacks in Assembly and Bytecode; explained concepts regarding software security - encryption, obfustication, and server-sided values, as well as how hackers can exploit each of the security precautions. This respository contains my collection of Flash game and Minecraft mods written in Assembly, injected into memory using Cheat Engine.
