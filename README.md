# Basic Hacking and Security
I am the admin on [Fandom's Official Cheat Engine Wiki](https://cheat-engine-restored.fandom.com/wiki/Cheat_Engine_Wiki). The Wiki touches on program security and goes in-depth on what encryption looks like in memory. This respository contains my collection of Flash game and Minecraft mods written in Assembly, injected into memory using Cheat Engine.
